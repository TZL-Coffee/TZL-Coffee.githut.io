This afternoon, just as I was about to finish work, an order came in for an iced Americano. Not long after, another order for an iced Americano came through. And then another.

I finished them all, went home, had dinner, and suddenly got a call from the delivery driver asking if I had placed the order for the second one. I was confused and asked what he meant. He said he had been asking around but no one knew of an 11th floor in that area. It had been three hours, and no one was picking up their phone. Me???

I started trying to contact the customer, but no answer. I double-checked the other orders for iced Americanos, luckily they were all valid. I called my family and we went to that place together. How could there be a 15th floor without an 11th?

When we arrived, I asked an elderly man who knew the area well. That place... indeed...

I immediately called the delivery driver and said, "I found the 11th floor."

"Found it?" he asked.

"Yeah, but I dare not go up..."

"???... Wait for me downstairs for a moment..."

We followed the delivery driver upstairs, knocked on the door with no answer, and even though the phone rang through, there was no answer. After a while, we left.

Today, just as our online service opened, another identical order came through. I immediately called to confirm.

Today, she answered the phone unexpectedly...

"Did you just order an iced Americano?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"Did you order the same thing yesterday too?"

"Yes, but the delivery guy didn't come, right?"

I was even more puzzled. She knew the delivery didn't arrive yesterday, yet she wasn't anxious, didn't complain, and didn't leave a bad review? And today, early in the morning, she ordered the same thing again?

"The delivery guy didn't manage to reach you on the phone yesterday, and I went to the address you provided but found no one there. Are you sure that's the correct location?"

"I'm sure."

When the delivery guy arrived, I asked if he wanted to confirm the order via phone. He said it wasn't necessary. If he couldn't reach them, he would just discard the order...

Today, an internet user suggested I call the delivery guy to confirm what happens after he completes an order. Apparently, he's aware of things like this. He asked me to check with him.

Here's the crucial part!!

He said!! Yesterday's order, they still didn't accept the food!! They called to confirm, and the person said they had urgent business and had left. They told the delivery guy to just mark it as delivered and take it for himself. So from my end, it looked like the delivery guy confirmed delivery at the roadside.

Just a moment ago, I was worried about her safety. Now, I just want to call the police. So horrible!
